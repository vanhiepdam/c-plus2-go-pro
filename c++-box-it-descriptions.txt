Design a class named Box whose dimensions are integers and private to the class. The dimensions are labelled: length , breadth , and height .

The default constructor of the class should initialize , , and  to .

The parameterized constructor Box(int length, int breadth, int height) should initialize Box's  and  to length, breadth and height.

The copy constructor BoxBox ) should set  and  to 's  and , respectively.

Apart from the above, the class should have  functions:

int getLength() - Return box's length
int getBreadth() - Return box's breadth
int getHeight() - Return box's height
long long CalculateVolume() - Return the volume of the box
Overload the operator  for the class Box. Box   Box  if:

 < 
 <  and ==
 <  and == and ==
Overload operator  for the class Box().
If  is an object of class Box:

 should print ,  and  on a single line separated by spaces.

Constraints


Two boxes being compared using the  operator will not have all three dimensions equal.

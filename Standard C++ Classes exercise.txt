13.6 Exercises
1. Suppose s is a std::string object.
	(a) What expression represents the number of characters that make up s?
		s.length();
	(b) What expression represents the first character in s?
		s[0];
		s.at(0);
	(c) What statement would insert the character 'x' onto the front of s?
		s.insert(0, 'x');
	(d) What statement would append the character 'x' onto the back of s?
		s += 'x';
2. Compared to C strings (see Section 11.2.6), what advantages does the C++ std::string type offer
to programmers?
	conveniant
	methods
	c++ string does not contain null terminator
3. A palindrome is a string of text that reads the same forwards and backwards. Examples include:
• “TENET”
• “STEP ON NO PETS”
• “RATS LIVE ON NO EVIL STAR”
All these strings are examples of strict palindromes where spacing and punctuation must reverse
exactly. Complete the following function that determines if a given string is a strict palindrome. It
should return true if the string is a strict palindrome and false otherwise.
The empty string reads the same forward and backward, so it is a palindrome. Your function should
ignore capitalization (that is, the string “Tenet” is regarded as a palindrome).
bool palindrome(const string& s) {
	int d = s.length() - 1;
	for(int c = 0; c < s.length(); c++, d--) {
		if(tolower(s[c]) != tolower(s[d])) {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}
4. What is the class of the std::cout object?
	iostream ?
5. What is the class of the std::cin object?
	iostream ?
6. Suppose the user types in a line of text and presses the enter key. For example, the user might type
the following:
The sky is blue
What C++ statement could you use to assign to a std::string variable named msg the complete
line of text, including spaces?
string msg;
char input;
while(cin >> input) {
	msg.push_back(input);
}
7. Consider the following C++ program:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
int main() {
std::string w;
std::ifstream x("results");
while (x >> w)
std::cout << '[' << w << "]\n";
}
(a) Explain what the program accomplishes.
	print the content of file "results" on console
(b) What does the variable x represent?
	name of the file
(c) As it currently is written, what does the program expect that may not be true?
	the file is empty or it can not open the file for some reason ... i guess..
(d) What would cause the program to print nothing?
	the file is empty
(e) How can you improve the program so that it always provides feedback to the user, even it the
expectation in part #7c?
	"after operation "while"" if(w.empty()) {
									cout << "file is empty." << endl;
										}
